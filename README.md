# Rice-crop-classification

The goal is to predict the presence, or non-presence, of rice crops at a given location.
The study of rice crops is not new. Researchers and government organizations routinely use satellite data to identify the location of agriculture crops and forecast yield. Unfortunately, there is no ideal solution that yields perfect results. So, we continue to make progress by taking advantage of increasing amounts of publicly available satellite data and improvements in cloud computing and machine learning. In time, we will get better at understanding agriculture from space. But, this data gives YOU the chance to make contributions toward solving world hunger and improving food security!
